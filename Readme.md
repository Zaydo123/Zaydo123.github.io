# Resume Project

This project is a personal resume website created using HTML and CSS. The website showcases my professional experience, education, skills, and projects. It includes the following features:

- **Resume Display**: The main page (`index.html`) displays my resume in a well-structured format. It includes sections for education, experience, extracurricular involvement, projects, and skills.
- **Last Updated Date**: The website dynamically displays the last updated date of the resume, which is fetched from a text file (`public/date.txt`) and updated using a GitHub Actions workflow.
